# The Safehouse
Safehouse is a work-in-progress (WIP) application designed to test and showcase my skills with Ruby on Rails for backend development and ReactJS + Tailwind for frontend.
It consists of two projects:

Backend:
- A single-version API built with Ruby on Rails, including a series of automated tests;

Frontend:
- It consists of a web app where you can create and manage survivors in a zombie apocalypse. As a survivor, you will be able to create your account, manage your inventory, buy resources, update your location, and flag people as dead. As a manager, you will be able to manage your survivors, oversee the local shop (inventory, prices, availability), and configure different settings (for example, determining how many survivors need to flag someone as "dead" for it to be considered true).
  
All of this is a work in progress for study purposes, and there is no plan to publish this in any way.
