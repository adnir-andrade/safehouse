GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Guide
===================

Pre-requisites for Development:
-----------------

Before starting development on the Safehouse project, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1) Install Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Git is essential for version control. Follow the installation guide for your operating system:

- `Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_

2) Generate an SSH Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generating an SSH key is crucial for secure communication with GitLab. Follow this guide to generate an SSH key:

- `Generating a new SSH key and adding it to GitLab <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html>`_

3) Request Development Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to develop on the project. Contact the project maintainer in GitLab to request access.

4) Install Ruby, Rails, and TypeScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure you have the necessary programming languages and frameworks installed for development:

- `Install Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/>`_

- `Install Rails <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html>`_

- `Install TypeScript <https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/>`_

5) Read the Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure to read the documentation for both the Backend and Frontend sections, which are available at the end of this documentation. They are shorter and more objective, I promise.

    By following these steps, you will be ready to start developing on the Safehouse project. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please reach out to the project maintainer.
